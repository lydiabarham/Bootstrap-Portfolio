# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Portfolio built using Bootstrap

##Description 

This portfolio site is a remake of the original site I made. This time using Bootstrap. I was motivated to do this to learn how to utilise and customise Bootsrap, to allow me to understand how to put together websites quickly in the future using open source code. 

In the future, I will add a lot more examples in the "my work" section based on projects that I am working to complete.

##Usage 

To use the site, use the navigation bar to link to sections within the page. Each section offers some information, links to pages I have created so far, and links and info on how to contact me. There is also an accordian featuring all the skills that I hope to learn throughout my EdX bootcamp.
